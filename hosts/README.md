# finland-north-1

This is an example config which uses bcachefs for Ethereum CL and EL

Currently, a number of assumptions are made:
- the disks are already formatted with bcachefs
- the Wireguard tunnel server is already configured
- JWT token has been initialized in the directories of both CL and EL
